## Streams

It provides guidance of how changes flow from one branch to another. It makes sure each change gets
to right branch, in right way. The connections between streams tell how they are related. The
hierarchy shows their relative stability. Dev branches are farther from final release and stable
branches are clsoe to final release. 

## Main
