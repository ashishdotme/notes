## Custom pipe

To create a custom pipe, we have to import Pipe and Pipe transform from Angular/Core.
We can use our custom pipe by importing it in app module.

```tsx
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from "@angular/core";
@Pipe({
  name: "sqrt"
})
export class SqrtPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(val: number): number {
    return Math.sqrt(val);
  }
}
```
