# Greedy Algorithms

### Introduction

In greedy algorithms, we find the optimum solution. The closest solution which may be optimum is chosen. It may lead to optimized solutions but mostly greedy algorithms do not provide globally optimized solutions.

### Examples

1. Travelling salesman problem

2. Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

3. Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

4. Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm

5. Graph - Map Coloring

6. Graph - Vertex Cover

7. Knapsack Problem

8. Job Scheduling Problem
