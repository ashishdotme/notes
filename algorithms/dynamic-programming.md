# Dynamic Programming

In Dynamic programming we break up a problem into a series of overlapping subproblems and build up solutions to larger and larger subproblems.

### Examples

1. Fibonacci number series
2. Knapsack problem
3. Tower of Hanoi
4. All pair shortest path by Floyd Warshall
5. Shortest path by Dijkstra
6. Project scheduling
