# Divide and Conquer

In Divide and Conquer, the problem is divided into smaller sub-problems and then each problem is solved independently. The solution of all sub problems is merged to get the solution of the origin problem.

### Examples

1. Merge Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. Binary Search
4. Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
5. Closest pair (points)
