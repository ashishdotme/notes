Redux is used to change the state of application.

## Three principles of Redux

1. Single source of truth - State of whole application is stored in a single tree
2. State is read only - Only by emitting action, we can change the state of applcation
3. Changes are made with pure functions - Reducers which are pure functions can only change the state
