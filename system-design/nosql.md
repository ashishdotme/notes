1. **Scalability**
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Easily distribute data across multiple servers.
2. **Data Model Flexibility**
    - **Dynamic Schemas**: When your data structure is evolving or unstructured.
3. **Performance**
    - **High Volume of Reads/Writes**: Low-latency requirements for large datasets.
4. **Specific Use Cases**
    - **Big Data Applications**: Handling massive data and analytics.
    - **Real-Time Applications**: Such as chat apps or IoT platforms.
    - **Content Management Systems**: With varied and flexible content types.
### Key Considerations

- **Consistency vs. Availability**: Decide based on your application needs (CAP theorem).
- **Data Relationships**: NoSQL is better for denormalized data but less ideal for complex joins.
